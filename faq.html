            Do you use a piercing gun?
        </h3>
        <h4>
            No. We use sterile, single-use hollow needles for our piercings.
        </h4>
        <h3>
            How old do you need to be to get a piercing?
        </h3>
        <h4>
            You must be 18 years old with proper identification to receive a piercing without a parent.
            Minimum ages with a parent's permission vary by piercing, and your parent or guardian
            must be present with proper ID for both of you.
        </h4>
        <h3>
            What is proper ID?
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Anyone getting pierced must have an unexpired photo ID with name and birthdate.
            This can be a driver's license, state-issued ID, passport, or birth certificate with a student ID.
            If you are under 18, you must present your photo ID with name and birthdate, and your parent
            must be present with their photO ID and documentation proving that they are your guardian. 
            This can be a birth certificate or court paperwork.
        </h4>
        <h3>
            Are your tools sterile?
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Yes. Everything we use is either sterilized and single-use, or used once and then
            cleaned and sterilized in our autoclave.
