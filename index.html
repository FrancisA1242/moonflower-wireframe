    <h2>
        Welcome!
    </h2>
    <p>
        We opened in 2001 as a small gift shop. We
added our piercing studio in 2003 after a
formal apprenticeship. Due to an increase in
popularity, we expanded to our second floor
in 2009, where our piercings are done today.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>We are currently a second generation family
        business. Our owner completed her formal
        apprenticeship for piercing in 2009. She is
        blood borne pathogen certified and First Aid
        and CPR certified and runs the shop with the 
        help of her husband. They live in Manchester
        with their dog and three cats.
